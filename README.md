Create a Simple Calculator in Python
Calculators are used to perform multiple mathematical operations at once. The objective here is to develop an interactive Calculator in Python language.

Here are all the steps you will have to perform before you can readily play with your new project:

Making all the necessary imports.
Defining a master window and creating the top portion of the calculator.
Defining the functions of adding text and performing the calculations.
Creating and placing the numbers, operators, equal sign, all clear, and clear buttons.
Creating the final OK button.
